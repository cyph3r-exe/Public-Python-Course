#Welcome to the free course of Python on GitHub. I am cyph3r
#I will be guiding you through this course. Hope you are ready to go 
# on an adventure never ventured before. No matter you are a skilled
#   professional programmer or just a newbie, this course will start from the
#   roots and never end. Yes, we will keep add new files, updates, logs, project code
#   and much more to this repository. 

#Before we get started, hope everyone is running this code, in VS Code or PyCharm. 
# I suggest you to use VS Code, as it is great for leaning purposes. 

#So, Python is a strongly typed programming language, which can be used in many fields today
# in the world of computer science. To get started, in this module we will learn how to get a single line 
# Hello World into our Terminal. #Don't wrorry the terminal is nothing but the command prompt, where usually
#all code is run. 

#To print "Hello World" just use the function of print(). Print allowes you to print end number of
#numbers, strings anything you want, to the terminal. In other words it is the 
#function which is used to give the output. 

#Here is an example, 
print("Hello World")

#This above code will print hello world.
