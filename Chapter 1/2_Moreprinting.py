#Now that you know how to print simple sentences, its times for you to learn
# or know that you can perform basic mathematical operations too using print() fintion

#For example 
print( 1 + 2 ) #This will not print 1 + 2, instead it would print 3 to the terminal

#But what if we want to print ! + 2 instead of the result? Simple, we will put the same in double quotes
print( "1 + 2 ") #this should print ! + 2 to the terminal. 

#With the calculation feature, you can also work up other operations like, multiplication 
# , division, subtraction and much more. 

#Example of Multiplication
print( 3 * 4 )

#Example of Subtraction
print( 81 - 72 )

#Example of Division
print( 36 / 9 )

#All calculations in python follow the BODMAS rule. We will learn more about it in the next module. 

#We have given a question for you to practice. Do check it out in the Practice Question Section. 
# Its a markdown file, will be easy for you to read and understand. :)
