#With this we come to the end of our first chapter. 

#In this chapter, you learnt How to print sentences and also perform simple calculations using 
# using the print() function. 

#In the next chapter we will be learning more on printing . Some new topics like concatenations 
# and variable declaration (Basic) and data types. 
# Till then stay hyped and keep practising. 

#If you find any errors in the code, or anywhere in the course of that sort, send up a pull request, 
# I will review and merge them in. :)
